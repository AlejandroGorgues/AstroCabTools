        # AstroCabTools
        
        Set of tools made in order to:
        
        + Integrate processing tools, algorithms, visualization and data analysis of images and 3D infrarred spectroscopy for the James Webb Espacial Telescope (JWST).
        + Integration of JWST calibrated data  and advance products into astronomics data bases and astrophisics specialized packages.
        + Develop procedures to the JWST data combination and the joint analysis of large volumnes of data.
        + Simulation and study of observationes made from the MIRI tool of the JWST with the MIRISim simulator.
        
        ## Tools
        
        + mrs_chan.py - To identify wich channels from the MRS range, an emitted wavelenth is (BETA version).
        + mrs_spec_chan.py - Visualization of relationship emitted wavelength and density flux associate (BETA version).
        + mrs_det_plot.py - Manipulation of astronomic images based of frame and integration values (BETA version).
        + fit_line.py - Representation of multiple gauss fitted models based on an spectrum.
        + cube_ans.py - Representation and analysis of miri cubes

        > We have detected a problem with older versions of Mac not working with newer versons of pip because it can not found any version of matplotlib avaliable, for this case it is recommended to create an enviroment with a **pip version** no more than **20.2.2**.
        
        ## How to install and execute
        
        > It is recommended to install and execute the tools in a clean enviroment with Anaconda or similar to prevent the conflict of package versions.
        
        If you have plans to use Anaconda, simply follow this steps once you activate it:
        
        1. Create the environment with `conda create --name myenv python=3.7` (replace `myenv` with the environment name)
        2. Activate the environment with `conda activate myenv` or `source activate myenv` if the previous one did not work (replace `myenv` with the environment name)
        3. Install and execute one of the tools from AstroCabTools following the instructions below
        
        If you are already in your conda environment or you do not need to, follow the next steps to install and execute the tools from AstroCabTools:
        
        1. Open the terminal and write `pip install AstroCabTools`
        2. Once all the libraries had been updated and the package installed, to execute each program, the next commands need to be written on the terminal:
         - `bandChan` to execute mrs_chan.
         - `specChan` to execute mrs_spec_chan.
         - `detPlot` to execute mrs_det_plot.
         - `fitLine` to execute fit_line.
         - `cubeAns` to execute cube_ans.
         - `subViz` to execute mrs_subviz.
         - `quick_spec` to execute quick_spec.
         - `allTools` to execute all_tools.
        
        ### Manually installation
        If your plan is to download from this repository and install it manually, execute `pip install .` inside the folder.
        Rather than using the python install, this makes all the packages to be installed in the same folder where the libraries can not find any problem of not finding libraries where they should be.
