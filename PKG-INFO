        # AstroCabTools
        
        Set of tools made in order to:
        
        + Integrate processing tools, algorithms, visualization and data analysis of images and 3D infrarred spectroscopy for the James Webb Espacial Telescope (JWST).
        + Integration of JWST calibrated data  and advance products into astronomics data bases and astrophisics specialized packages.
        + Develop procedures to the JWST data combination and the joint analysis of large volumnes of data.
        + Simulation and study of observationes made from the MIRI tool of the JWST with the MIRISim simulator.
        
        ## Tools
        
        + mrs_chan.py - To identify wich channels from the MRS range, an emitted wavelenth is.
        + mrs_spec_chan.py - Visualization of relationship emitted wavelength and density flux associate.
        + mrs_det_plot.py - Manipulation of astronomic images based of frame and integration values.
        + fit_line.py - Representation of multiple gauss fitted models based on an spectrum.
        + astro_tools - Interface that allows to load each tool without using command line.
        
        ### Packages used
        
        For each tool, this repo uses a number of libraries and packages on python:
        
        + [PyQt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt) - Binding of C++ GUI library
        + [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Library that allow large data manipulation
        + [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Graph visualization library.
        + [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) - Collection of software packages used for astronomy
        + [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Statistical data visualization
        + [Lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io//lmfit-py/) - Non-Linear Least-Squares Minimization and Curve-Fitting for Python
        + [PyPuSub](https://github.com/schollii/pypubsub) - A Python publish-subcribe library
        
        ### Requirements
        + Python (tested for 3.8.0)
        + Matplotlib (tested for 3.1.2)
        + Numpy (tested for 1.81.1)
        + PyQt5 (tested for 5.14.0)
        + Seaborn (tested for 0.9.0)
        + lmfit (tested for 1.0.0)
        + PyPubSub (tested for 4.0.3)
        
        ## How to install and execute
        1. Open the terminal and write `pip install AstroCabTools`
        2. Once all the libraries had been updated and the package installed, to execute each program, the next commands need to be written on the terminal:
          	- `bandChan` to execute mrs_chan.
          	- `specChan` to execute mrs_spec_chan.
          	- `detPlot` to execute mrs_det_plot.
          	- `fitLine` to execute fit_line.
        	- `allTools` to execute all_tools.
        
        ### Development
